# Soloidty-SmartContract
MyToken is a basic Solidity smart contract that implements a simple token with the ability to mint (create new tokens) and burn (destroy tokens). It tracks the total supply and individual balances of users, allowing for token creation and removal while maintaining secure and transparent token management.
